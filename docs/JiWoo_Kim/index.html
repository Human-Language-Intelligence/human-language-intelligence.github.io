            <h2>About</h2>
<p>Greetings! I'm a Master student at SungKyunKwan University in Human Language Intelligence Lab. I'm particularly interested in how languages vary among different communties, as online communities grow in a world-scale. That's why my research mainly focuses on social dielect in Neural Machine Translation. Now I am doing K-Pop related research, so if someone who is reading this is involved in any fandom, please feel free to contact me about anything! </p>
<p>Before starting my work in here, I received my Bachelor's degree on Confucian Studies and Eastern Philosophy. In addition, I took courses on Construction, Landscape Architecture designing. I dreamed to be a journalist, which I admire since highschool aged, and had related experiences. </p>
<p>If you have any questions or would like to know about me, please contact me! I'm always happy to connect with others who share my interests.</p>
