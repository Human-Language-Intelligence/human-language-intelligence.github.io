            <h2>About</h2>
<p>Greetings! I'm a Master student at SungKyunKwan University in Human Language Intelligence Lab. I'm particularly interested in how languages vary among different communties, as online communities grow in a world-scale. That's why my research mainly focuses on social dielect in Neural Machine Translation. Now I am doing K-Pop related research, so if someone who is reading this is involved in any fandom, please feel free to contact me about anything! </p>
<p>My journey into this fascinating field has been shaped by a rather unique and diverse background: With a Bachelor's degree in Confucian Studies and Eastern Philosophy, I delved into the profound philosophies that have shaped societies for centuries. Alongside, I also delved into subjects seemingly unrelated yet equally intriguing, such as Construction and Landscape Architecture designing. The multitude of lexicons, nuances, and meanings woven into diverse linguistic communities captured myself, ultimately guiding me to the captivating NLP.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or would like to know about me XD, please contact me! I'm always happy to connect with others who share my interests! :D </p>
